     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     Unit 5 asks for the first five sections. Unit 6 adds the five below them.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images.

     ⚠️ The confusion matrix especially. The notebook prints one as a markdown
     table, ready to copy. A screenshot of a matrix earns nothing. Paste the
     table.

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 5 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Your community, and what your classifier sorts posts into. Three or four
     sentences. -->



---

## Label Taxonomy

<!-- Each label: a one-sentence definition and two real examples from your
     reading. Then your decision rule for the hardest boundary.

     The decision rule is worth a point on its own and it's the thing most
     people leave out. Every taxonomy has a hardest boundary. Name yours. -->

Four labels. The question every label answers is the same one: **what is
this comment offering the reader, and what is it standing on?**

### `experience`

**Definition:** Supports its point mainly with something the writer personally
did, built, used, measured or saw happen.

**Example 1:**
> I have also been using 5.6 Sol instead of 6. I found 6 to burn through my usage incredibly quick, making it somewhat unusable because I wouldn't be able to get anything done.
>
> My results with 5.6 Sol were quite similar to 6, although I haven't tested it that much.

**Example 2:**
> That's the very reason I vibed my own daemon. I don't want the Logitech binary blob on my system. It needs too many permissions, it's huge, hogs memory and telemetry built in.
>
> My vibe coded daemon is just a few hundred LOC of go code I can inspect, modify and trust.

### `argument`

**Definition:** Supports a claim about the topic with at least one reason a
reader could check or dispute on its own — a fact, a number, a mechanism, a
source, an outside example — rather than the writer's own experience.

**Example 1:**
> Yes, that's how the trick works. Profit is revenue minus expenses. By increasing expenses, you decrease profit, and therefore tax. But it only works if you had a profit before, because the government doesn't pay you back tax when you lose money.

**Example 2:**
> And in 2018 the Pixel 2 was the Android flagship with 3 years of updates promised, with a Snapdragon 835 that was half the single thread speed of the corresponding A11 and slower in multicore with two extra cores.

### `assertion`

**Definition:** Takes a position on the topic — a verdict, a prediction, an
opinion, a sarcastic jab at the subject — and offers nothing to support it
beyond the claim itself.

**Example 1:**
> Mozilla is not a company though.

**Example 2:**
> Stock prices always include the expected future profits, that's the market rates a stock

### `chatter`

**Definition:** Makes no claim about the topic at all: thanks, praise or jabs
aimed at a person or their project, clarifying questions, concessions, bare
link drops, and talk about the thread itself.

**Example 1:**
> Hey. Thats looks really cool. Thanks!

**Example 2:**
> No! Surely not? Where did you read that?

### The hardest boundary

**Which two labels:** `argument` vs `assertion`. Hacker News commenters almost
always attach *something* to an opinion — a "because", an analogy, a "look at
X". Whether that something counts as support is where I kept stalling.

The post that sat right on it:

> The real farce is that you don't get paid for recycling. Really demonstrates that it's a complete charade.
>
> If there was any value in recycling you'd pay some fee for the packaging, and you'd get it right back when you recycle it.
>
> Outside of aluminum cans and bottle it certainly looks like recycling ends up being 'send it to the landfill, but with some extra steps and fees.'

**The decision rule I used every time:**

> **Delete the conclusion and look at what's left.** If what's left is a reason
> a reader could check or argue with *separately* — a fact, a number, a
> mechanism ("if it had value, you'd be paid for it"), a named example, a
> source — it's `argument`, even if the tone is a rant and even if the reason
> is wrong. If what's left is the conclusion said again more forcefully, an
> "everyone knows", a bare link, or nothing, it's `assertion`.

Under that rule the recycling post is `argument`: the deposit-refund mechanism
and the aluminum-can exception are reasons you can dispute on their own.
Being *wrong* doesn't move a post out of `argument`; having *no reason* does.

**The two other boundaries, and their rules:**

- **`experience` vs `argument` — the deletion test again.** Delete every
  first-person sentence ("I tried", "at my job", "we measured"). If the
  support collapses, it's `experience`. If outside facts or reasoning still
  carry the claim, it's `argument`, and the anecdote was colour.
- **`assertion` vs `chatter` — topic or people?** A claim about the subject of
  the thread is `assertion`, even as a joke or one-word verdict. Thanks,
  praise for the poster's own project, jabs at another commenter, "what did you
  mean?", and "you're right, my mistake" are `chatter`. A question that is
  really a claim ("So when will LLVM be rewritten in Rust?") is judged as the
  claim — here `assertion`.
- **A claim beats chatter.** If a post thanks someone *and* takes a position
  on the topic ("Great writeup, thanks — though I think you're wrong about
  compile times"), the claim decides the label, judged by its support.
- **Vague first person isn't `experience`.** "In my experience it's always
  worse" or "every benchmark I've seen says otherwise" names nothing the
  writer actually did. `experience` has to say what was done, used or seen.
  Otherwise it's judged as a bare claim.

## The Dataset

<!-- Where you collected from, how you labelled, your counts, and three hard
     cases. -->

**Where the posts came from:**

**How I labelled them:** <!-- Cold first? Pre-labelled with AI and corrected?
Say so plainly — the disclosure is required, not penalised. -->

**Counts per label:**

| Label | Count | Share |
|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
|  |  |  |
| **Total** |  | 100% |

**Three hard cases**

<!-- Any post that made you pause: what it was, which two labels it could have
     been, and what you chose. These are worth more than the easy 190. -->

**1.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Could have been:*
>
> *I chose, because:*

**2.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Could have been:*
>
> *I chose, because:*

**3.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Could have been:*
>
> *I chose, because:*

## The Training Run

<!-- Your starting model, your settings, and anything you changed and why. -->

**Base model:**

**Settings:** <!-- epochs, learning rate, batch size, seed -->

**Anything I changed from the defaults, and why:**

**Split sizes:** <!-- train / val / test, and per-label counts in the test
split. If a label had fewer than about 8 in test, say so — it explains a lot
of next unit's variance. -->



---

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments — what you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     ⚠️ Plus disclosure of any pre-labelling. If you had a model pre-label a
     batch and then read and corrected every one, say that. It's an allowed
     workflow and disclosing it costs you nothing. Not disclosing it is the
     problem. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:*
- *What came back:*
- *What I changed:*

**Pre-labelling disclosure:**

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 6 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 5.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

---

## Baseline vs. Trained

<!-- Both models on the same posts. `python baseline.py --trained results.json`
     prints this table for you. -->

| Measure | Baseline | Trained | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Overall accuracy |  |  |  |
| Macro F1 |  |  |  |
| F1 — `label_one` |  |  |  |
| F1 — `label_two` |  |  |  |

**What I predicted before I looked:**
<!-- Milestone 1 asks you to write this BEFORE seeing the trained numbers. A
     prediction made afterwards isn't one. -->

**What the gap actually means:**
<!-- If the baseline matched your trained model, your fine-tuning added
     nothing — and that is a real finding, not a failure. Say it plainly. -->



---

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria across three seeds. The notebook's section 6 prints the
     spread table; the Target and Verdict columns are yours. -->

| Criterion | Target | Seed 42 | Seed 7 | Seed 2024 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |

### Confusion matrix

<!-- ⚠️ TYPED AS A MARKDOWN TABLE. The notebook prints one ready to paste.
     An image of a matrix earns nothing. -->

| true \ predicted |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|
| **** |  |  |  |
| **** |  |  |  |
| **** |  |  |  |

**My biggest off-diagonal number, and what it means:**
<!-- Not "the model made mistakes" — WHICH boundary it didn't learn, and which
     direction. "7 real analysis posts were called hot_take and only 3 went the
     other way" is a direction, not just an error rate. -->



---

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED against LAST UNIT's target. The target has to hold across
     all three seeds, not turn up sometimes. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

<!-- For each miss: the cause, and how you know. The four common causes are:
     too few examples for a label, a boundary you applied inconsistently, a
     genuinely hard label pair, and a task the model can't reach from this
     much data.

     ⚠️ Use your agreement report as evidence. It is the only instrument you
     have that can tell a LABELLING problem from a MODEL problem, and this
     section is graded on whether you used it that way. -->



---

## Agreement Report

<!-- Your rate against the staff set, and every disagreement adjudicated.

     Remember you labelled these 30 under the STAFF taxonomy in
     data/staff_taxonomy.md, not your own — so every argument below is made
     from those definitions and those decision rules. -->

**Agreement rate:** ___ / 30 = ___%

<!-- Nobody grades this number. A 60% who argues every disagreement from the
     stated rules beats a 95% who wrote "staff was right" nine times. Several
     of the 30 were chosen because they're genuinely ambiguous — you should be
     winning some of these. -->

**Disagreements**

<!-- Three lines each: the post, both labels, and who you think is right and
     why — grounded in the staff definitions you were both applying.

     Then sort each into one of three piles:
       (a) the rule covered it and I applied it loosely → a consistency problem
       (b) the rule genuinely doesn't say               → a gap in the definitions
       (c) the rule is ambiguous here and my reading is defensible → argue it.
           This is a legitimate win.

     Pile (a) is the one that matters most for your diagnosis: if you applied a
     written rule two different ways on 30 posts, that is direct evidence about
     what you did across your own 200. -->

**1.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Staff said / I said:*
>
> *My call, and why:*
>
> *Which pile:*

**2.**
> *The post:*
>
> *Staff said / I said:*
>
> *My call, and why:*
>
> *Which pile:*

**What the pattern in my disagreements tells me:**



---

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Which diagnosis pointed at it:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Seed 42 | Seed 7 | Seed 2024 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it didn't, say so. Relabelling that didn't help is a genuinely
     interesting result and earns full credit. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped. -->



**The gap between what I meant my labels to capture and what the model
learned:**
<!-- Two sentences. Your confusion matrix is the evidence. -->
